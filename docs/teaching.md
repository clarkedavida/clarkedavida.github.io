# Teaching 

I've had the opportunity to do a lot of physics teaching at several levels.
For various classes I've been a tutor, a teaching assistant (TA), or a grader.
Recently I've been the Instructor of Record some classes, including a small class that exposes
first-year undergraduates to lattice field theory. This was made possible through the
[Science Research Initiative](https://science.utah.edu/sri/).

## Lecture weeks

[HGS-Hire](https://hgs-hire.de/) offers several courses to help develop skills for
graduate students, including soft skills and coding skills. These courses are taught
either as ``power weeks", which involve lots of hands-on activities, or lecture weeks.
I was a trainer for the following courses:

- [Clean software development](https://github.com/AxelKrypton/Clean-software-development)

## Python pedagogical talks

Bielefeld University was partnered with two other German universities in a CRC; this
was essentially a collaboration to tackle the QCD phase diagram using multiple methods.
One of my responsibilities was to help teach interested CRC members, in particular
young scientists like grad students and postdocs, some basics of using Python. These
pedagogical talks are a result of that.

- [OOP in Python](pdfs/pythonOOP2021.pdf)
- [Targeting performance with Python](pdfs/pythonFAST2021.pdf)

## Talks about teaching

Every year the [American Association of Physics Teachers](https://www.aapt.org/) hosts
a conference about teaching physics. Sometimes I share something about my teaching
experience when I'm there.
