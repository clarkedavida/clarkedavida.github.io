## Python pedagogical talks

Bielefeld University was partnered with two other German universities in a CRC; this
was essentially a collaboration to tackle the QCD phase diagram using multiple methods.
One of my responsibilities was to help teach interested CRC members, in particular
young scientists like grad students and postdocs, some basics of using Python. These
pedagogical talks are a result of that.
