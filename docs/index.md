# David Clarke, Physicist 


I’m David, a researcher using [lattice field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_field_theory), to study particle physics. 
Lattice field theory is a framework that is especially well suited for computer simulation.

One of my research topics is strongly interacting matter at finite temperature and density. When this matter becomes sufficiently hot and dense, 
it exists in a state known as [quark-gluon plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark%E2%80%93gluon_plasma) (QGP). Physicists are interested in QGP, 
in part because it dominated the early universe, a fraction of a second after the Big Bang. QGP can be probed in heavy ion experiments, 
which are carried out at [CERN](https://home.cern/science/physics/heavy-ions-and-quark-gluon-plasma) and [Brookhaven](https://www.bnl.gov/rhic/).

Right now I’m working as a postdoc at [University of Utah](https://www.physics.utah.edu/). I’m going to help with lattice input to a calculation of 
the [anomalous magnetic moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalous_magnetic_dipole_moment) of the [muon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon).
