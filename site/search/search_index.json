Lattice field theory is a framework that is especially well suited for computer simulation.</p> <p>One of my research topics is strongly interacting matter at finite temperature and density. When this matter becomes sufficiently hot and dense,  it exists in a state known as quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Physicists are interested in QGP,  in part because it dominated the early universe, a fraction of a second after the Big Bang. QGP can be probed in heavy ion experiments,  which are carried out at CERN and Brookhaven.</p> <p>I also help with lattice input to calculations of  the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, \\(a_\\mu\\). Parts of \\(a_\\mu\\) can be calculated using either lattice methods or so-called dispersive methods, the latter of which have extremely tight error bars commensurate with experimental error. There is some discrepancy between the \\(a_\\mu\\) determined using dispersive input and \\(a_\\mu\\) measured in experiment. If this discrepancy were confirmed, it would be exciting to the physics community, since it would indicate a specific region where our current theory of particle physics, the Standard Model,  breaks down.

These companies would make, for example, some of the parts needed for machines used in factories to create soda cans. One thing that he was always very proud of was the precision with which he could make these parts; in particular he would brag that his product matched specifications \u201cto within a tenth of the thickness of a human hair\u201d. This might seem mundane to some of you engineers, but it is actually a rather impressive feat, especially when you try to visualize how tiny a hair\u2019s breadth is compared to, for example, the soda can.</p> <p>To see how impressive this feat is, let\u2019s compute the relative precision necessary to manufacture a can to within a tenth of a human hair\u2019s thickness.  (This is not exactly the problem they were solving, but it is close enough for point of this discussion.) The largest dimension of a typical North American  drink can is its height, which is 12.3 [cm] or 1.23 x 10<sup>-1</sup> [m]. Meanwhile a nominal width for the thickness of a human hair is 75 [\u03bcm] or  7.5 x 10<sup>-5</sup> [m]. This comes out to a relative precision of</p> <p>rel. prec. = 6.1 x 10<sup>-4</sup>,</p> <p>or about six parts in ten thousand! If that number doesn\u2019t mean anything to you, you can get a visual impression of it by simply placing a soda can on top of one of your hairs. Can you tell that the soda can is sitting crookedly, albeit only very, very slightly? I didn\u2019t think you could.</p> <p>I would now like to connect this story with precision physics. Our current best theory of particle physics is known as the Standard Model (SM). How good is it? Well dear reader, it describes a rather imposing five percent of all matter and energy that exists in the universe. Oh also it doesn\u2019t describe gravity, or explain why there is more matter than antimatter, or explain how neutrinos get their masses. Actually there is a whole laundry list of problems with the SM, which motivates modern high-energy physicists to find so-called Beyond Standard Model (BSM) theories.</p> <p>Nevertheless we still trust the SM. There are many reasons for this, but the primary reason is this: it gives accurate experimental predictions for physical processes involving, and characteristics of, the fundamental particles that we know for sure exist. These predictions range in precision, but the most precise is that of the electron anomalous magnetic moment.</p> <p>What is this quantity? The magnetic moment of a charged particle is the torque that particle experiences when you turn on a magnetic field. The electron,  being a charged particle, has its own magnetic moment that can be calculated classically. If you repeat this calculation in quantum field theory aka QFT  (QFT is the framework on which the SM is based) and are as \u201clazy\u201d as possible, you will find that the classical result for the magnetic moment changes by   an overall factor. We call this factor g, and if you are lazy, you get g=2. If you are more enterprising, you can do harder calculations in QFT to find    that g is very slightly different from 2. We label this deviation from 2 \u201canomalous\u201d, and hence we call (g-2)/2 the \u201celectron anomalous magnetic moment\u201d.</p> <p>The electron anomalous magnetic moment is, to my knowledge, the single most precisely measured quantity in history, and it agrees with the prediction from theory to more than 10 significant figures. As of the time of this writing, the relative precision with which the electron anomalous magnetic moment is measured is</p> <p>rel. prec. = 7.3 x 10<sup>-13</sup></p> <p>or about 7 parts in ten trillion. This is about a billion times more precise than the machining of the soda can.</p> <p>Perhaps we will one day discover a more sophisticated theory than the SM that solves or explains all the issues listed above. But we will never be rid of the SM entirely; it delivers some of the most accurate and precise predictions ever made, so in that regard, it describes reality better than any other scientific theory. Hence it will be an important limiting case of BSM theories, and it will likely continue to be useful at energy scales currently accessible to us.</p> <p>We\u2019ll probably keep making soda cans about the same though.</p>"},{"location":"research/","title":"Research","text":"<p>My research interests are all connected by lattice field theory, but they span several topics within high energy theory and software development.

On the theoretical side, it can be subdivided into QED, electroweak, and hadronic contributions, the latter of which cannot be obtained perturbatively. The hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution  can be computed using lattice QCD or using the dispersive method, a data-driven approach that takes experimentally measured cross sections as input. \\(a_\\mu\\) has been of particular interest to the community, as state-of-the-art experimental results compared to theoretical results extracted using the dispersive approach exhibited about \\(4.2\\sigma\\) tension in 2020. If that discrepancy were confirmed, it may indicate another possible signal for physics beyond the Standard Model (SM).  Since then, a lattice determination by the BMW Collaboration fell between the dispersive and experimental results, which has been updated to favor the experimental  result, albeit using some additional experimental input. Meanwhile the situation for the dispersive approach has become somewhat ambiguous, as new measurements from CMD-3 lie in tension with older results. Independent lattice input is urgently needed, and I help the Fermilab-HPQCD-MILC collaboration to that end. </p> Publications <ul> <li>2025: R. Aliberti, T. Aoyama, E. Balzani, A. Bashir, G.

Its landscape has implications for the evolution of the early universe, the content of neutron-star cores, and understanding non-perturbative aspects of the QCD Lagrangian.  It was recognized relatively early on that there is a temperature threshold, the Hagedorn temperature, beyond which strongly interacting systems are not described well by the thermodynamics of ordinary nuclear matter. Since then, the community has mapped out many features of the diagram: broadly, there is a hadron-gas phase at low \\(T\\) and/or \\(\\mu_B\\) and a quark-gluon-plasma phase for high \\(T\\) and/or \\(\\mu_B\\). For sufficiently small \\(\\mu_B\\), this phase change is a crossover. At large enough \\(\\mu_B\\) the phases are expected to be separated by a first-order line. There has been substantial effort both theoretical and experimental in the form of heavy-ion collisions (HICs) to find the critical endpoint (CEP) at which the first-order line terminates. My research uses a variety of approaches to put bounds on the location of the CEP using lattice QCD. I also compute other properties of the medium, e.g. its material parameters or how observables scale approaching various transition points, especially for initial conditions similar to those in HICs.</p> Publications <ul> <li> <p>2026: D.
