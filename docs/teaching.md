# Teaching 

I've had the opportunity to do a lot of physics teaching at several levels.
For various classes I've been a tutor, a teaching assistant (TA), or a grader.
Recently I've been the Instructor of Record for a small class that exposes
first-year undergraduates to lattice field theory.
This was made possible through the
[Science Research Initiative](https://science.utah.edu/sri/).

## Python pedagogical talks

Bielefeld University was partnered with two other German universities in a CRC; this
was essentially a collaboration to tackle the QCD phase diagram using multiple methods.
One of my responsibilities was to help teach interested CRC members, in particular
young scientists like grad students and postdocs, some basics of using Python. These
pedagogical talks are a result of that.

## Talks about teaching

Every year the [American Association of Physics Teachers](https://www.aapt.org/) hosts
a conference about teaching physics. Sometimes I share something about my teaching
experience when I'm there.
