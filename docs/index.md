# David Clarke, Physicist 


Iâ€™m David, a postdoc at [Bielefeld University](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/) using [lattice field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_field_theory) 
to study strongly interacting matter. 
Lattice field theory is a framework that is especially well suited for computer simulation.

One of my research topics is strongly interacting matter at finite temperature and density. When this matter becomes sufficiently hot and dense, 
it exists in a state known as [quark-gluon plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark%E2%80%93gluon_plasma) (QGP). Physicists are interested in QGP, 
in part because it dominated the early universe, a fraction of a second after the Big Bang. QGP can be probed in heavy ion experiments, 
which are carried out at [CERN](https://home.cern/science/physics/heavy-ions-and-quark-gluon-plasma) and [Brookhaven](https://www.bnl.gov/rhic/).

I also help with lattice input to calculations of 
the [anomalous magnetic moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalous_magnetic_dipole_moment) of the [muon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon), $a_\mu$.
Parts of $a_\mu$ can be calculated using either lattice methods or so-called dispersive methods, the latter of which have extremely tight
error bars commensurate with experimental error. There is some discrepancy between the $a_\mu$ determined using dispersive input and
$a_\mu$ measured in experiment. If this discrepancy were confirmed, it would be exciting to the physics community, since it would indicate
a specific region where our current theory of particle physics, the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model), 
breaks down. I am helping with lattice determinations of the hadronic-vacuum-polarization contribution to $a_\mu$.
