# Learning 

I like to record what I learn as I learn it. I think it helps me to restructure some
concepts into my own words, and it's useful to be able to refer to my own notes later.

## Research Notes

I started my [Research Notes](https://github.com/clarkedavida/researchNotes) when I was
a grad student, and I add to them whenever I get the time. Eventually I would like it
to be a somewhat self-contained textbook-esque collection that can be useful for anyone
starting in lattice research.

## Metadata

One of the projects I have helped with is the [ILDG](https://hpc.desy.de/ildg/), which
is the lattice community's attempt to store large numbers of configurations using a common
format with searchable metadata. One can argue which metadata framework is optimal.
[Here](pdfs/JSONXML.pdf) is my attempt to understand some of the differences between
JSON and XML.
